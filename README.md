# imo2015-regression-python

This project was created as part of the "Econometrics" course and aims to find the relationship between the number of total points scored by countries at the 2015 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and a series of 10 explanatory variables, selected by the author.

The project consists of two parts:

Part 1:
In the first part of the project, I mainly focus on data preparation and creation of a linear regression model. I conduct a simple analysis, presenting the results in the first three pages of the PDF explanatory file. I use a variety of statistical techniques to find the relationships between variables, and test the assumptions of the linear regression model.

Part 2:
The second part of the project focuses on improving the model. I perform the reduction of non-significant independent variables and apply various transformations to the variables to better fit the model to the data. All these steps are presented on the third page of the PDF file.

Project structure:
1) A csv file with the data used in the project
2) Python file: this is a Python language script that performs data analysis from the csv file. It uses various statistical techniques and modeling to identify relationships between variables.
3) PDF File with the Description of the Python Script: This file contains a detailed description of the analysis performed in Python. It contains information about the methodology, results and conclusions of the study.
